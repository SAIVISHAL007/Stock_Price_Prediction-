---

##  Dataset
The dataset was retrieved using the **Yahoo Finance API** using the `yfinance` Python library.  
We selected stock data for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** from **2015 to 2023**.

##  Model Architecture
- LSTM Layer (50 units) → return sequences
- LSTM Layer (50 units)
- Dense Output Layer (1 neuron)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error

---

##  Model Evaluation
We used **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to evaluate our model's performance.  
A comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices is also visualized.
